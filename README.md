# Youtube_data_analysis
This is a portfolio project that I made, where I dig into the data of a YouTube channel using the YouTube API and show various intricate data points which are important.

I used python for pulling the data using YouTube API, cleaning the data, exporting it into an excel file (to visualize later), also doing the preliminary EDA.

I used Tableau to show the data through an interactive dashboard.

If you're an youtuber and want this kind of work for your channel at very affordable rates as well, drop a mail at kaustavpal23@yahoo.com or dm me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustav-pal-b14876201/
